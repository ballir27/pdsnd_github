### Project Title
US Bikeshare Exploration Project
Project completed by Robert (Alex) Balli

### Description
This project allows a user to explore bikeshare data from January through June 2017 for 3 different cities: Chicago, NYC, and Washington.

After giving the user the option to filter by city, month, and day of the week, the program gives a general output with basic cumulative information about the data, as well as an option to look at the raw data.

The general output has 4 sections:

1) Most Frequent Times of Travel, including:
  Most popular month to travel
  Most popular day of the week to travel
  Most popular hour of the day to travel

2) Most Popular Stations and Trip, including:
  The most popular starting station
  The most popular ending station
  The most popular starting and ending station combo

3) Trip Duration, including:
  Total travel time for the subset of filtered data
  Average travel time for the subset of filtered data

4) User statistics, including:
  Counts of each type of user
  Counts of gender (male/female)
  The earliest birth year in the subset of data
  The most recent birth year in the subset of data
  The most common birth year in the subset of data
